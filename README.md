# ChaosEquation
A Java project enabling the visualization of chaos equations. Chaos equations are parametric equations that are also be defined in terms of the previous `x` and `y` coordinates of the point

Visualizations can be found on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY7qOxzqHAI&list=PLYXpZqs-CVggnCNCgpsyUX1fK65kNV5VF)
